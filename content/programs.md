## neomutt

The email client.



LARBS also comes with the [mutt-wizard](https://muttwizard.com) script, which does the annoying task of configuring mail accounts with mutt and even easily allows offline email storage for fast, local processing and indexing of mail.

Abook is a minimal and local store of your contacts, including emails, phone numbers, addressess and whatever you might need.
Abook integrates with neomutt's autofill as well and you can script more functionality into it.
